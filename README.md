#  WebTasks: My HTML & JavaScript Practice Journey

Welcome to my **WebTasks** repository!  
This project contains hands-on tasks and practice exercises I completed while learning the fundamentals of **HTML** and **JavaScript**. Each task helped me understand the basics, build mini projects, and level up my frontend development skills. 🌱💻

## 🧾 What's Inside

### 🟠 `html tasks/`
This folder includes basic HTML projects and structure-based tasks such as:
- Creating webpages with headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Building forms with input fields, labels, and buttons
- Using tables, links, and images
- Semantic tags and HTML5 layout concepts

Each file here focuses on **structure and layout**, helping me understand the skeleton of a webpage.

### 🔵 `js tasks/`
This folder includes tasks focused on **JavaScript fundamentals**, such as:
- Writing basic scripts and understanding variables, loops, and functions
- Form validation using JS
- DOM manipulation (changing elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.)
- Simple interactivity like toggling content or responding to button clicks

These helped me bring interactivity and behavior into otherwise static HTML pages.

## 🚀 My Learning Goals
Through these tasks, I aimed to:
- Strengthen my core web development skills
- Practice clean and readable code structure
- Understand the connection between HTML structure and JS logic
- Build a foundation for future React and full-stack development

## 📌 Note
All tasks are self-practice and part of my learning path. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
